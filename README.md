Transformations
===============

Perform various image transforms.
The code helps produce image with various image transforms such as
1) Scaling
2) Rotation
3) Similarity
4) Affine
5) Perspective

Each transform can be configured with different parameters for generation of the dataset. 
For convenience, default values generate the dataset for most of the variations encountered in real world images.
